# Building Blocks of a Decision-Tree
# 
# Decision-Tree: data structure consisting of a hierarchy of nodes.
# Node: question or prediction.
# 
# Three kinds of nodes:
# 1. Root: no parent node, question giving rise to two children nodes.
# 2. Internal node: one parent node, question giving rise to two children nodes.
# 3. Leaf: one parent node, no children nodes --> prediction.
# 
# Information Gain (IG)
# 
# Criteria to measure the impurity of a node I(node):
#     gini index,
#     entropy

# Nodes are grown recursively.
# At each node, split the data based on:
# feature f and split-point sp to maximize IG(node).
# If IG(node)= 0, declare the node a leaf

# Generalization Error
# =============================================================================

#Supervised Learning - Under the Hood
#Supervised Learning: y = f(x), f is unknown.
#
#Goals of Supervised Learning
#1. Find a model f hat that best approximates f: f hat â‰ˆ f
#2. f hat can be LogisticRegression, Decision Tree, Neural Network ...
#3. Discard noise as much as possible.
#4. End goal: f hat should acheive a low predictive error on unseen datasets.
#
#Difculties in Approximating f
#1. Overtting: f hat(x) ts the training set noise.
#2. Undertting: f hat is not exible enough to approximate f
#
#Generalization Error
#Generalization Error of f hat : Does f hat generalize well on unseen data?
#It can be decomposed as follows: Generalization Error of
#
#f hat = bias^2 + variance + irreducible error
#
#Variance
#Variance: tells you how much f hat is inconsistent over different training sets.
#
#Bias
#Bias: error term that tells you, on average, how much f hat â‰  f
#
#Model Complexity
#
#ModelComplexity: sets the exibility of .
#Example: Maximum tree depth, Minimum samples per leaf, ..

# =============================================================================
# Estimating the Generalization Error
# =============================================================================
How do we estimate the generalization error of a model?

Cannot be done directly because:
1. f is unknown,
2. usually you only have one dataset,
3. noise is unpredictable

Solution:
split the data to training and test sets,
fit f hat to the training set,
evaluate the error of on the unseen test set.

generalization error of f hat â‰ˆ test set error of f hat.


# =============================================================================
# Better Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation
# =============================================================================

#Test set should not be touched until we are condent about f hat's performance.
#Evaluating on training set: biased estimate, has already seen alltraining points.
#Solutionâ†’Cross-Validation (CV):
#1. K-Fold CV,
#2. Hold-Out CV
#
#Diagnose Variance Problems
#If suffers from high variance: CV error of f hat > training set error of f hat. 
#f hat is said to overt the training set. To remedy overtting:
#1. decrease model complexity,
#i. for ex: decrease max depth, increase min samples per leaf, ...
#ii. gather more data

#As the complexity of fÌ‚  increases, the bias term decreases while the variance 
#term increases

# Diagnose bias and variance problems

#Advantages of CARTs
#Simple to understand.
#Simple to interpret.
#Easy to use.
#Flexibility: ability to describe non-linear dependencies.

#Limitations of CARTs
#Classication: can only produce orthogonal decision boundaries.
#Sensitive to small variations in the training set.
#High variance: unconstrained CARTs may overt the training set.

# Ensemble Learning
# =============================================================================

#* Train different models on the same dataset.
#* Let each model make its predictions.
#* Meta-model: aggregates predictions ofindividual models.
#* Final prediction: more robust and less prone to errors.
#* Best results: models are skillful in different ways.
